I'd say that MS's strength comes from the fact that it was willing to undersell the existing players at the time it started becoming more powerful, provided a fairly gentle learning curve, and exploited lock-in as much as possible.\n\nWhen I pull down a Linux distribution, I have the full-blown development environment that everyone else in the world uses.  I have valgrind, which instruments the code to effectively create a VM for diagnostics.  I have editors with decades of contributions from around the world.  I've sloccount and doxygen.  I've a fast, easy-to-use make system (which unlike the MS system, works well with hierarchical sub-projects shared across projects).\n\nThey failed to produce a standard ABI for C++ (COM is basically an attempt to produce part of a standard ABI).\n\nTheir scripting system was the weak, verbose batch system.\n\nMS has some tools (the Visual RAD stuff) that allow one to throw up a front end quickly.  They aren't exceptional -- I'd say that Apple's Hypercard was an easier-to-learn, cleaner contemporary -- but if you haven't any familiarity with anything similar, they're usable.\n\nC# fills the high-level programming language gap on Windows.  It's like Java or Python.  It calls out to C fairly well (though Microsoft went out of their way to make Win32 access from C# miserable).  It's not the Second Coming, though.\n\nVisual Studio used to come with a profiler.  I think the \"Enterprise Architect\" version or something like that still does.  The stock one doesn't.  Gprof is a pretty standard tool in the Linux world.\n\n/proc provides a marvelous interface for even simple tools to access fairly complex data.  It's reasonable to write tools in perl or shell that would almost certainly be C/C++-based on Windows.\n\nThere is a powerful, inherently parallelized mechanism for writing scripts (pipelines) in the Unix world.  Microsoft's shell lacks a lot of the pipeline functionality (and totally lacks the necessary POSIX programs) to make this a workable development environment.\n\nWin32 is large and not well-designed.  There are, what, about three network APIs, (standard blocking/nonblocking that's shared with POSIX, asynch, IOCP-based)?  How many \"*Ext\" functions do you run across in Win32?  The Unix world has a fraction of these, despite many more years running around.  tmpnam() might qualify as downright misdesigned, but I can't think of masses of broken-by-design Unix APIs.\n\nWhat specific characteristics do you feel are exceptional about MS as a development environment?","author_flair_css_class":null}

People who treat a police officer with basic human respect, as a professional doing a job that society has entrusted them to do, will likely get respectful treatment in return. That doesn't mean being subservient, just polite and civil.\n\nOne might say that letting even the slightest infraction go without a ticket is actually costing local taxpayers, and failing to enforce the Will of the People. Getting away with stuff *is not an entitlement*. Officer's discretion means that it's their call whether it's in the public interest to ding you for your broken taillight or going 5 miles over, or let you off easy. \n\nSwearing at an officer, treating him like an idiot, or trying to lie your way through an encounter  will naturally wear out any goodwill a cop might have; and so again, it should be no surprise if they use their discretion to help you.\n\nOrganizations like Flex Your Rights say the same thing.\nhttp://www.flexyourrights.org/traffic_stop_scenario\n\n&gt;2) Be Courteous &amp; Non-Confrontational\nIf you are pulled over, the first thing you should to do is turn your car off, turn the dome light on (if it's nighttime), roll down the window, and keep your hands on the steering wheel. Don't immediately reach into your glove compartment for your license and registration. Officers want to be able to see your hands for their own safety. Wait until the officer asks to see your paperwork before retrieving your documents.\n\n&gt;The first thing you should say to the officer is, \"Hello officer. Can you tell me why I am being pulled over?\" The officer may give you a hard time or say, \"Why do you think I pulled you over?\" Tell the officer you don't know. Most importantly, do not apologize after you get stopped, because that can be considered an admission of guilt and could be used against you later in court.\n\n&gt;Show your identification if it's requested. Be respectful and non-confrontational. Refer to the police as \"Sir,\" \"Ma'am,\" or \"Officer.\" Remain calm and quiet while the officer is reviewing your documents. If the officer writes you a ticket, accept it quietly and never complain. Listen to any instruction on paying the fine or contesting the ticket, and drive away slowly.","author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"score":4,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score_hidden":false,"controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","edited":true,"downs":0,"archived":true,"id":"c02s9zn","ups":4,"author":"sylvan","gilded":0,"name":"t1_c02s9zn","link_id":"t3_64861"}

A huge driver for the decline of the middle class in the US (and Europe) is the move offshore of the \"middle class\" manufacturing jobs.  Sure, those folks found other employment, but only a very few move up (technology) and quite a few of them move down (service sector) and that influx of people into the service sector has driven down pay pretty much everywhere.  \r\n\r\nEnough of that happens and your market is a fraction of the size it is now, is more based on necessities than fringe benefits and the allure of the world's biggest market starts to dry up.\r\n\r\nNot that this is necessarily a bad thing, given the overconsumption in North America, but I'm not going to pretend this shift won't have social issues.

Why?  Because \"special needs\" kids get twice the funding of regular kids and are exempted from any standards.  Most Mexican parents who don't know any better go off thinking the school system is doing them a huge favor.\n\nSecond, many of the Mexican kids will come home with straight A's on their tests and homework no matter how bad or incorrect the answers are - the teachers and administrators just pass them thru the system for the funding, but then blow them off knowing darn well that their parents will never know the difference.  \n\nThere is one exception, at standardized test time (where funding is involved) - the schools literally terrorize the kids.  It was so bad, I saw kids coming home crying in fear over those tests.\n\nHow dare they call those things schools.  If you ask me they can't shut those fucking things down fast enough.

{"author_flair_css_class":null,"body":"I agree; but an officer exercising his discretion in deciding whether or not to ticket someone for a bylaw offense *is* being responsible so long as there is actually evidence of an infraction. They're given the authority to make a judgement call; and it's completely natural that a cop would be more lenient towards someone who is dealing with them honestly, fairly, and civilly, than one who is irate and abusive towards them.\n\nNow if an officer is shown to be consistently favoring whites over blacks/hispanic, then there's cause for investigation &amp; discipline.\n\nI'm not talking about anything along the lines of police brutality/assault, or making up charges/offenses where there isn't one. I read the statement above: \"Our state has over 5000 traffic laws, I can find one to help you get over your tude.\" as meaning that he is willing to overlook many minor infractions; but if someone's giving him a hard time, he'll hold you to the letter of the law. Not that he'd make up non-existent infractions. That's supported by what he says at the end: \"Im still a nice guy, treat me like one and you might just get a warning.\"\n\nThere are good cops and bad cops. They're not all taser-happy thugs who don't understand civil rights or due process.
